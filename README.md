# StartScreen
A Recreation of the Windows 8.x Start Screen<br>
Made with .NET C# using WPF and WinForms

## Known Issues
- High Memory Usage when first launch, it stays around ~100mb after a few seconds
- (Atleast for me) All Apps lags in battery mode on laptop, aka when not plugged in<br>
  Probably due to so much items in that Menu

## How-to
To use this as a start menu, use open-shell custom commands

## To-Do
- Use p/invoke or native code to replace the actual start menu instead of using Open-Shell
- Do some optimization for the ram usage issue

## Any help with the code/assets is appreciated
